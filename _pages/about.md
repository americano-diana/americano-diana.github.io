Starting this blog to keep a collection of my projects in Machine Learning & Neuroscience - as well as other interesting topics.

# About Me

I have a background in Psychology from the Universidad de Guadalajara in Mexico, where I did 3 specializations in Neuropsychology, Social Psychology and Special Educational Needs.

I am interested in the neuro-, social- and psychological research of mental health, as well as applying mathematical and computational approaches to neurocognitive research. 

I did 1 year of studies in mathematics & physics before I began the master's in Cognitive Neurosciences. During my studies in Germany I gained experience working as a student and research assistant in various institutions, including Max Planck Institute of Human Development, Freie Universität, Humboldt Universität and a consultant company. 

I believe in open, accessible, fair and inclusive science and technologies, and as I dwelve deeper into NeuroAI-topics I believe it is most important to advocate for these principles.

Currently looking for potential PhD or post-graduate positions as a researcher or engineer in Deep Neural Networks or other ML and neuro-related topics. Feel free to reach out if you want to have a chat!
